# Eat-n'-Split
This is a simple React application designed to help track expenses among friends when dining out together. It displays a list of friends along with their current balances, indicating who owes whom.

## How It Works

The application consists of a sidebar displaying a list of friends and their balances. Each friend's balance is represented by their name, profile picture, and an indication of whether they owe money or are owed money. If the balance is negative, it means the friend owes money, and if it's positive, it means they are owed money. A balance of zero indicates that the friends are even.

## Features

- **Friend List:** Displays a list of friends along with their balances.
- **Balance Indicator:** Indicates whether each friend owes money or is owed money.
- **Interaction:** Provides a button to select a friend, which can be further extended for interaction, like settling debts or adding new expenses.
